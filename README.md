# 📊 Sales Insights Dashboard Project (Power BI)

## 🚀 Overview

This project aims to simulate a real-world corporate data analysis scenario using Power BI. We analyze sales data for a fictional company, **AtliQ Hardware**, to help the Sales Director make **data-driven decisions** by building a comprehensive and interactive sales dashboard.

This is ideal for aspiring **data analysts** or **data scientists** who want hands-on experience in executing end-to-end BI projects just like in the industry.
